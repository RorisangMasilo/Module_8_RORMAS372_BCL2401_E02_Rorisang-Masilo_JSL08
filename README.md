# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

## Project Brief

A Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. For our banking system, let's use the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information.

Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your JavaScript projects, making your code cleaner and more efficient. By understanding and applying these patterns, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex design challenges in your projects, just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services.

## Development Objectives

This challenge will test your ability to create a function with the Singleton Pattern.

## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

**Console.log** - Console logging the code and having the code reflect the result.

### Challenges Encountered

**Singleton pattern** - Understanding the patttern, its functionality and how to use it, that was a bit difficult to understand, but seeing it in use allowed me to better understand it.

### Areas of Improvement

**Understanding concepts** - The methods of how I go about understanding concepts could definitely improve, although it has, it is still a constant area of improvement in maintaining my focus and concentration.

### Overall Learning Experience

This project was inspiring to imagine how banks and their products'/services' scripts operate, inspiring me to further analyse how their apps and online banking feature work behind the scenes for future employment purposes.
