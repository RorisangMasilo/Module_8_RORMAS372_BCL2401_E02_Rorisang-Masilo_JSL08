# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

## Project Brief

A Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. For our banking system, let's use the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information.

Design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your JavaScript projects, making your code cleaner and more efficient. By understanding and applying these patterns, you'll be well-equipped to tackle complex design challenges in your projects, just as a well-organized bank efficiently manages its operations and services.

## Development Objectives

This challenge will test your ability to create a function with the Singleton Pattern.
